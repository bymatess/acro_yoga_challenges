acroyoga_challenges
=====================
Small side project to have a website where people could share their acroyoga positions and challenge each others :-)

TODO:

allow to delete position 
number of conquerors -- select and send it to the template
tweaks of UI
	-- list of positions - portrait vs landscape pics
!!!performance of loading photos

----- AFTER DEV -----
refactoring -- sure, you are going to do that...
refactor MYSQL -- longer description, about...
refactor position.mason -- jquery functions...
fill in with default photos
create some categories
proof-read/translation

----- IDEAS -----

geolocation of users



----------------------------------------
Done:
display my profile and edit + upload user photo
tweaks of UI
	-- error/ok flash divs 
handling of "Challenge me" button
handling of "Conquered" button
disable "Community" in top menu - or replace with FB link - or develop something for that 
template for categories + handling
home page
upload_photo form handling
registration/login/signout
login with facebook ( FB's ID and Secret missing in source code)
